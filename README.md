# SPPU-BE-COMP-Laboratory-Practice-III-Lab-Practicals

Welcome to the **SPPU-BE-COMP-Laboratory-Practice-III-Lab-Practicals** repository! This repository contains the practical codes for **Laboratory Practice III (LP-III)** for Fourth Year Computer Engineering students at **Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)**.

The repository is organized into folders and files representing different practical exercises, grouped by their respective categories: **Group A, B, and C**.

## Practical Groups

- **Group A:** Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
  Focuses on algorithm design techniques including divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, backtracking, and branch and bound. Assignments involve Fibonacci sequence calculation, Huffman Encoding, Knapsack problem, n-Queens problem, and more.

- **Group B:** Machine Learning  
  Covers data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks. Practical tasks include Uber fare prediction, email spam detection, customer churn prediction, gradient descent, and K-Means clustering.

- **Group C:** Blockchain Technology  
  Provides hands-on practice with blockchain fundamentals, such as wallet creation, smart contracts, and Hyperledger. Tasks include creating Ethereum wallets, writing banking smart contracts, and a mini-project to develop a decentralized e-voting system.

Each group folder contains:
- **Assignment Code**: Source code files for each practical exercise.

This repository is a comprehensive resource for applying concepts of algorithms, machine learning, and blockchain technology, supporting the SPPU Computer Engineering curriculum.
